Types of methods

Notes:
1) A variable declared inside the class is called as class variable
2) A variable declared inside the constructor ( __init__) is called
    as instance variable.


Classification of methods:

Methods can be classified into 3 types
1) instance methods ---> (i) accessor methods  (ii) mutator methods
2) class methods
3) static methods

instance method: It will act on instance variables
accessor methods: They read the instance variables. They do not modify.
They are used with the help of getter() method. --> get method
mutator methods: They not only read but can also modify the instance variables.
 They can be used with the help of setter() method. --> set method
